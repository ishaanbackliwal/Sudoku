Sudoku

A Sudoku game w/ a GUI created with Pygame that allows the user to play a round of Sudoku with instant feedback on each guess through a backtracking algorithm.

The current implementation of this game only allows for the given sudoku board to be played, although the source code in *gui.py* can be modified to play a different board.
